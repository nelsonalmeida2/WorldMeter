
WorldMeter
WorldMeter is a Java-based application developed to analyze and visualize global population data. It processes CSV datasets containing information about countries, cities, and population figures, providing insights through various analytical tools.

🌍 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment at Universidade Lusófona, focusing on data structures and algorithms. It demonstrates proficiency in:

Reading and parsing CSV files

Organizing data using appropriate data structures

Implementing search and sort algorithms

Presenting data-driven insights

🔧 Features
Data Parsing: Efficiently reads and processes large CSV datasets.

Data Analysis: Performs various analyses, such as population trends and city distributions.

Modular Design: Organized codebase following best practices for maintainability.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language.

CSV Parsing: Custom implementation for reading data files.

JUnit: Framework for unit testing.
